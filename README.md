# Temperature forecast using Long Short-Term Memory

The `weather_forecast.ipynb` shows an implementation of a deep learning based temperature forecasting model. The models task is to predict the temperature for a given days into the future using a walk-forward prediction approach.

The data used for the prediction is from the [Reliable prognosis](https://rp5.ru/) weather archive. The `rp5_weather.csv` file stores weather data from the Budapest/Lorinc weather station from 2016.10.01 to 2020.10.25.
